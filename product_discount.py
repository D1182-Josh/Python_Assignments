    #TASK

 #Aretailer is having a store-wide "buy 2, get 1 free" sale. For legal reasons, they can't charge their customer $0 for an article so a discount is applied to all products instead. For example, if a customer gets three products a , b and c: 
 Product A $15.99
 Product B $23.50
 Product C $10.75
She gets the cheapest one for free, so she ends up paying $15.99 + $23.50 = $39.49 , but what her receipt says is: 
 Product A $15.99 - Special discount = $12.57
 Product B $23.50 - Special discount = $18.47
 Product C $10.75 - Special discount = $8.45
 Total : $39.49
 #Create a function that takes is a list of prices for a customer's shopping cart and returns the prices with the discount applied. Round all prices to the cent.
