    #TASK

#Write a function that select all words that have all  the same vowel (in any order and /or number) as the first word, indluding the first word.
#Examples 
    same_vowel_group(["toe", "ocelot", "maniac"]) --> ["toe", "ocelot"]
    same_vowel_group(["many", "carriage", "emit", "apricot", "animal"]) --> ["many"

#            Notes: Words will contain only lower case latter, and may contain whitespaces. Frequency does not matter ( e.g. if the first word is " loopy", then you can include words with any number of o's, so long as they only contain o's, and not other vowels).
