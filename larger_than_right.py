    #TASK

# Create a function that retrieves every number that is strictly larger than every nymber that follows it. 
    Examples :
        larger_than_right([3, 13, 11, 2, 1, 9, 5]) --> [13, 11, 9, 5]
        13 is larger than all numbers to its right, etc.
    Must be strictly larger. Always include the last number. 
    larger_than_right([5, 5, 5, 5, 5,5]) --> [5]
    larger_than_right([5, 9, 8, 7]) --> [9, 8, 7]
    Notes
    The last number in an array is trivially strictly  larger than all numbers that follow it (no numbers follow it).
