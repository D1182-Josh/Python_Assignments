    #TASK

#2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
#What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?    

    #SOLUTION

nums = [i for i in range(1,21)]
nums_prime = []
for i in nums :
  prime = []
  for j in range(2,i) :
    prime.append(i % j != 0)
  if all(prime) and i != 1 :
    nums_prime += [i]
new_number = []
while True :
  for i in nums_prime :
    temp = []
    for j in range(len(nums)) :
      temp.append(nums[j] % i == 0)
      if nums[j] % i == 0 :
        nums[j] = nums[j] // i
    if any(temp) :
      new_number += [i]
  if sum(nums) == 20 :
    break
count = 1
for i in new_number :
  count *= i
print(count)
