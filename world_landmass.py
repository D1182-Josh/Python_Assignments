#   Create a function that takes a country's name and its area as argument and returns the area of the country's proportion of the total world's landmass. 

    Examples:
        ("Russia", 17098242) --> "Russia is 11.48% of the world's landmass"

        ("USA", 9372610) --> "USA is 6.29% of the world's landmass"

        ("Iran", 1648195) --> "Iran is 1.11% of the world's landmass"

    Notes:

        The total world's landmass is 148,940,000[Km^2]
        Round the result to two decimal places.
