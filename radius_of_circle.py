    #TASK

#   Imagine a circle and two squares: a smaller and a bigger one. For the smaller one, the circle is a circumcircle and for the bigger one, an incircle. Create a program, that takes an integer (radius of the circle) and returns the difference of the two squares. 

    Examples
        radius = 5 --> Output 50
        radius = 6 --> Output 72
        radius = 7 --> Output 98
