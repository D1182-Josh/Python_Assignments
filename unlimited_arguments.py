    #TASK

#   Given a function that accepts unlimited arguments, check and count how many data types are in those arguments. Finally return the total in a list. List order is: [int, str, bool, list, tuple, dictionary]

    Examples:
        [1,45,"Hi", False] --> [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
        [[10, 20,], ("t", "Ok"), 2, 3, 1] --> [3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

   #SOLUTION
