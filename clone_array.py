    #TASK

#The Code tab has a code which attempts to  add a clone of an array to itself. There is no error message, but the results are not as expected. Can you fix the code_
    Examples:
         clone([1, 1]) --> [1, 1, [1, 1]]
         clone([1, 2, 3]) --> [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3]]
         clone (["x", "y"]) --> ["x", "y"]]
