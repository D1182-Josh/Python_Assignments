    #TASK

#"Loves me, loves me not " is a traditional game in which a person plucks off all the pedals of a flower one by one , saying the phrase "Loves me" and "Loves me not" when determining whether the one that love, loves them back. Given a number of pedals, return a string which repeats the phrases "Loves me" and "Loves me not" for every alternating pedaş, and return the last phrase in all caps. Remember to put a momma and space between phrases.
