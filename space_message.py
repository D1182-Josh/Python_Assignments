    #TASK

#You  have received an encrypted message from space. Your task is to decrypt the message with the following simple rules:
#Message string will consist of capital letters, numbers, and brackets only.
#When there's a block of code inside the brackets, such as [10AB], it means you need to repeat the letters AB for 10 times.
#Message can be embedded in multiple layers of blocks.
#Final decrypted message will only consist of capital letters.
#Create a function that takes encrypted message txt and returns the decrypted message.
#Examples

#space_message("ABCD") ➞ "ABCD"

#space_message("AB[3CD]") ➞ "ABCDCDCD"

"AB" = "AB"

"[3CD]" = "CDCDCD"

space_message("IF[2E]LG[5O]D") ➞ "IFEELGOOOOOD"

        #SOLUTION
