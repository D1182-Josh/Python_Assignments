    #TASK

#   Write a program , persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit. 

    persistence(39) # returns 3 , because 3*9=27, 2*7=14, 1*4=4
                    #and 4 has only one digit

    persistence(999) # returns 4, because 9*9*9=729, 7*2*9=126,
                     # 1*2*6=12, and finaly 1*2=2
            
    persistence(4) # returns 0, because 4 is already a one-digit number
